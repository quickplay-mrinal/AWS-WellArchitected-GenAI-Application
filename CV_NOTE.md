## For Interview Talking Points

### 30-Second Elevator Pitch
"I built an AI-powered platform that automates AWS Well-Architected Framework assessments using Claude Sonnet 4. It scans cloud infrastructure across multiple regions, analyzes resources against best practices, and generates intelligent recommendations. The platform reduced manual audit time from 2 weeks to 15 minutes and identifies an average of $2,000 per month in cost savings. I used Python FastAPI for the backend, Next.js for the frontend, and AWS services including Bedrock, DynamoDB, and S3."

### 2-Minute Deep Dive
"The AWS Well-Architected GenAI Assessment Platform addresses a critical challenge organizations face: maintaining cloud best practices at scale. Traditional audits are time-consuming and expensive.

I architected a full-stack solution with three main components:

First, a Python FastAPI backend that orchestrates multi-region AWS scans using boto3, collecting data on EC2, RDS, Lambda, S3, and other services. I implemented background task processing for concurrent operations and designed an efficient DynamoDB single-table schema that reduced costs by 60%.

Second, AWS Bedrock integration with Claude Sonnet 4 for AI-powered analysis. I implemented RAG using Knowledge Base to provide context-aware recommendations across the 6 Well-Architected pillars. This achieved 95% recommendation accuracy.

Third, a Next.js 15 frontend with TypeScript and TailwindCSS, featuring real-time progress tracking, credential management, and automated report generation in PDF and Excel formats.

The results were significant: 99% reduction in audit time, average $2,000/month in identified savings, and 4.8/5 user satisfaction. The platform scales to 1000+ concurrent scans and maintains sub-second API response times.

This project demonstrates my ability to integrate cutting-edge AI with production-ready infrastructure, delivering measurable business value."
